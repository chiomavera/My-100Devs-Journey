//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let movies = ['bring It On', 'Indepence Day', 'Tailor My Heart']

//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
const firstMovie = movies[0]

//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable

const totalNumOfMovies = movies.length //variable.length gives the total number of elements in the array.

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?

const lastMovie = [movies.length - 1] //we are substracting 1 because index starts at 0, so the last element will always be one off!
